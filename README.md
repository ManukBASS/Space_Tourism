# Space Tourism 👨🏻‍🚀

"Space Tourism Multi-Page Website" is a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenge I developed using React Js and SASS.

The challenge is to replicate a page with multiple sections while also applying a responsive design.

Although the challenge invited the user to work with HTML, CSS and JS, I decided to use React and SASS to practice and test my skills!

The design was adapted from the Figma given by the [challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3).
